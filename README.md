# NVDA Stock Price Prediction
### Background and Objective
This project is the exercise applied from Coursera Project Network course which the objective is to learn how to build a Facebook Prophet Machine learning model in order to forecast the stock price 30 days in the future.

NVIDIA Corporation, founded in 1993, is a leading American multinational technology company known for its pioneering work in graphics processing units (GPUs). In recent years, Nvidia has also made significant strides in data centers, autonomous vehicles, and robotics, demonstrating their commitment to innovation and leadership in the semiconductor industry. This impressive growth and diversification have led to substantial increases in NVIDIA's stock price, making it an interesting candidate for predictive analysis in this project.

### Dataset
This project uses one year historical data of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) stock from 28 July 2023 - 28 July 2024 retreived from yahoo finance.

### Stock prediction analysis and recommendation
Using Prophet to forecast the next 30-day stock trend, the model suggests a continued increase in the stock price. In addition, the analysis highlights that Wednesdays are likely to show the lowest prices within the week. While these predictions provide valuable insights, it is crucial not to rely solely on this model for making buy-sell decisions. Traders should also consider additional financial data such as the P/E ratio, market capitalization, and cash flow, among others, to fully assess the company's financial health before making investment decisions.
